        As the morning approached, Jerald (aged 19) had a day off so he decided to enjoy his day. He started by eating his breakfast which was fried bread with asparagus and tasty pizza flavoured potatoes. Then, he attended his pickleball club. He was an excellent player and achieved 15 wins, 3 draws and 3 losses. As the afternoon arrived, he ate his bok choi and guacamole sandwiches and some chips with whipped cream, watching the vaquitas from the bench. After a while, he headid to cook something delicious. He made beef with strawberry sauce and mackerel with cucumber pearls. After munching that down, he ate his Jeromium Cheesecake costing 7 Jers and 499 Jes at the cafe he regularly goes to. After gobbling this up, he went to bed early so that he will have energy at work at the aeroplane factory.
